# Breadcrumbs Test Vault

This vault is used to test [Breadcrumbs](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs) and its features.

Tests are grouped into folder, with all the required notes inside. Generally, the `index.md` note is where you can check if the test is working as expected.

## Setup

It would be a bit unwieldy to store the `.obsidian` folder of the vault in this repo. So you'll have to do a bit of setup yourself.

- Clone this repo, and open it in Obsidian
- Enable plugins and install Breadcrumbs (potentially using the BRAT plugin to get the beta version)
  - You should probably also install Dataview, as some tests use it
- Copy the [data.json](./data.json) file to the `.obsidian/plugins/breadcrumbs` folder of the vault
  - This quickly sets up the same Breadcrumbs settings I use to test
- You should be good to go!
